# PID Tuning for ELE2038 Homework Assignment H4

This repository contains the Python code used to simulate the closed-loop step responses by 40369120 for the process:

\[
G(s) = \frac{0.5s+1}{(s+1)^3 (0.1s+1)}
\]

using two Ziegler-Nichols tuning methods:
- **Method 1:** Process Reaction Curve (FOPDT approximation)
- **Method 2:** Ultimate Sensitivity Method
